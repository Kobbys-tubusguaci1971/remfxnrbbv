OMG, just got done watching Snow White... again. Seriously, why do I always do this to myself? 😂 Those dwarfs... like are they just eternally chill or strictly workaholics? I mean, they sing about whistling while you work, but all I see is a bunch of serious commitment to free labor, you know what I mean? I half expect them to start a union or something. But then they’re just too adorable about it. Can you imagine Grumpy negotiating work benefits, lol?

> And fairytales, really, I don’t know what they teach us about life. Like, why is the prince doing all the saving? Let Snow White solve her own problems for once! Oh, man, did I just sound super woke? 🤦‍♀️ Think I’m just tired. Dunno, the evil queen’s like an entire mood though. Looking in mirrors and getting salty about what it says. Who hasn't been there? 🙄

Anyway, remember when we used to download the movie... like legally of course (wink-wink), just to get that sweet DVD experience? Yeah, streaming's cool and all, but the thrill was real back then. Miss those days, sorta. 

And WHY does watching this movie always make me crave apples? Not poison ones, obviously, but like, crunching into a solid, crisp apple? I swear, it's Disney's subliminal messaging or some kind of vibe. Or maybe I'm just hungry. But I’m also on snack lockdown - trying to eat healthier and all. Ah, what’s one apple, though, right? 

for i in range(3): print(why am I doing this?)

Honestly, just needed a break from thinking about crop rotations and pest management, and here's Snow White giving me some quirky life lessons. Anyway, chat later? Need a nap or just a strong coffee infusion. Life decisions, amirite?! 🌟
